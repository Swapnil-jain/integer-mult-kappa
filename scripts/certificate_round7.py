"""Round-seven witnesses, bit side: our two-stage interchange with retained totals, lifted frames and late copies,
and the stage-1 word reordered (deferred readouts, V leaves); notes/deferred-readout.tex. Two side programs:
  1. PR #62's producer (interval strips, core-aware pair assembly), checked in independent/deferred-readout/;
  2. PR #57's joint frame compiler on the COARSE=col side DAG (PR #69's balanced coarse sums, PR #60's
     reclamation order), with the phase-1 closure of read/write and frame-order edges, checked in
     independent/joint-frame-stack/. This is the headline.

The child-width histogram is rebuilt here from the frozen schedule (certificates/round7/): every role's frame chain
in time, the deferred readout levels on every target from the readout rows, and the X_S chains from the V-gate
order. Frame dimensions are taken from the data files; the checkers re-derive each frame exactly and replay the word.
Two data-entrance corners are reported: the round-six corner (runs h-2, 1^(h+1)) and the staircase corner (runs h-2,
h-5, 1^6, independent/deferred-readout/check_stair.py).
